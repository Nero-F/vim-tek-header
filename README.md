# vim-tek-header
This little plugin will allows my fellow tek students to put their epitech headers in their Makefiles, .c, .h, .cpp, .hpp files

# Installation
You can install it with your favorite vim package manager. 
I personally use [VimPLug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) so:
```
  " in your vimrc
  call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
  ...
  Plug 'Nero-F/vim-tek-header'
  ...
  call plug#end()
```
